# ðŸš€ Startup Success Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the **success or failure of startup companies** based on early-stage indicators like funding history, location, industry, and product stage.

It was developed as part of the **CSE 523/524 Advanced Project** coursework by Abhay Ravi Kumar.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Startups operate in highly uncertain environments, and understanding the early signals of their success can assist investors, accelerators, and analysts in making informed decisions.

Using a dataset of over 28,000 startups, this project applies:

- ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ðŸ”§ Feature Engineering (e.g., funding intensity, funding gap)
- ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
  - CatBoost
  - LightGBM
  - Ensemble (Stacking Classifier)

SMOTE is used to handle class imbalance, and Optuna is integrated for hyperparameter tuning.
